# Functional Programming and Concurrency in Elixir
### ID1019 Programming II

## About The Project
This repository contains my projects and assignments developed during a course focused on Functional Programming and Concurrency, 
given at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

The course explored advanced programming techniques in functional languages, with a special emphasis on Elixir.
Each assignment within this repository has its own separate README for detailed explanations. 
The course explored advanced programming techniques in functional languages, with a special emphasis on Elixir. 

All projects are developed and managed using Mix, Elixir's build tool.

## Course Content and Learning Outcomes

### Course Contents
- **Functional Programming Techniques**: This includes recursive definitions, immutable data structures, higher-order functions, and closures.
- **Concurrency**: The course covers multi-threading, including shared data structure modification and message-passing between processes.
- **Comparative Study**: The course also delves into the similarities and differences among various functional programming languages.

### Intended Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students are expected to:
- Implement recursion, pattern matching, and immutable data structures in a functional programming language.
- For advanced proficiency:
  - Utilize functions as first-class objects and handle higher-order functions.
  - Understand the fundamentals of functional programming, its structure, and operational semantics.
  - Analyze function efficiency in terms of time complexity.
  - Implement multi-threaded programming using message passing.

## Projects
Each project or assignment in this repository is accompanied by its own README
file, providing detailed information about the specific task, its
implementation, and how it demonstrates the concepts learned in the course.
