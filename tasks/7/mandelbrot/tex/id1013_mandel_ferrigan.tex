\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This assignment is about implementing a Mandelbrot set generator in
Elixir, which will ultimately produce an image of the Mandelbrot set. 
The steps outlined in the document are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item~\hyperref[subsec:cmplx]{Complex Numbers Module}: Implement a module to handle complex numbers,
    including functions for creating new complex numbers, adding two complex
    numbers, squaring a complex number, and finding the absolute value of a
    complex number.
    \item~\hyperref[subsec:brot]{Mandelbrot Computation Module}: Implement the core logic to determine
    if a given complex number belongs to the Mandelbrot set based on a maximum
    iteration depth.
    This involves calculating the sequence of complex numbers
    and checking if their absolute values exceed a certain threshold before
    reaching the maximum number of iterations.
    \item Image Generation: Using the PPM module to generate an image file from
    the calculated data.
    This involves translating the iterations needed to
    determine if a complex number belongs to the Mandelbrot set into color
    values to produce visual output.
    \item~\hyperref[subsec:color]{Color Module}: Implement a module to convert the depth (number of
    iterations) to RGB color values, which will be used to color the Mandelbrot
    image.
    \item Mandelbrot Set Generation: Combine all the above to generate the
    Mandelbrot set over a defined area and resolution, and save this as an image
    using the PPM module.
\end{enumerate}
This assignment is based on the instruction
\href{https://people.kth.se/~johanmon/courses/id1019/seminars/mandel/mandel.pdf}{'Generating a Mandelbrot Image'}
by course examiner Johan Montelius.

\section*{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
\subsection*{Literature Study}
\label{subsec:literaturestudy}
Elixir-syntax and similar topics were acquired
from both the
\href{https://elixir-lang.org/docs.html}{Elixir official documentation}
and the free Elixir Tutorial
\href{https://elixirschool.com/en}{Elixir School
website}.
The author also relied on textbooks found on
\href{https://learning.oreilly.com}{O'Reilly Media},
especially Brute Tate's
\href{https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programmer-passport-elixir/9781680509649/}{Programmer Passport: Elixir}.

\subsubsection*{Tools and packages}
\label{subsec:tools}
All code was written in \emph{IntelliJ IDEA}.
Quick-fixes and editing was, however, done in \emph{Vim}.
\emph{GIT} and \emph{GitHub} were used for version control.
Tests were performed with Elixir's built-in test framework \emph{ExUnit.}
The report was written in \LaTeX.
% For exploration and benchmarking, the interactive environment and notebook
% \href{https://livebook.dev/}{\emph{Livebook}}
% was heavily used.

\subsubsection*{Test Driven Development}\label{sec:ttd}
The development was an iterative approach with ''trail and errors''.
The author practiced
\href{https://www.elixirwiki.com/wiki/Test-Driven_Development_in_Elixir}{Test Driven Development}
(TDD).
The basic steps follow the \emph{Red-Green-Refactor cycle};
writing failing tests (Red), make them pass (Green),
and finally refactor the code.
For example, before creating all the necessary functions for the
\mintinline{elixir}{Cmplx} module,
one can first write a couple of test cases, as illustrated in the test-example below.
%TODO.
\inputminted[
    label=CMPLX TESTS,
    firstline=5,
    lastline=11,
    xleftmargin=-3mm,  % Adjust this value as needed
    fontsize=\footnotesize,
]{elixir}{../test/cmplx_test.exs}
\noindent The
\mintinline{elixir}{sqr/1} function is supposed to square the complex number
$1 + 2i$, where $i$
is the imaginary unit, with the formula for squaring binomials
$(a + bi)^2$ -- which is \(a^2+2abi-b^2\), noting that $i^2 = -1$.
\noindent So for $1 + 2i$:
\[(1 + 2i)^2 = 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2i + (2i)^2 = 1 + 4i - 4 = -3 + 4i\]
Which the test above is to assert.

The function was therefore created as follows:
\inputminted[
    label=sqr/1,
    firstline=42,
    lastline=45,
    xleftmargin=-3mm,  % Adjust this value as needed
    fontsize=\footnotesize,
]{elixir}{../lib/cmplx.ex}

\subsection*{Complex Numbers Module}
\label{subsec:cmplx}
The module
\mintinline{elixir}{Cmplx},
is designed to handle basic operations with complex numbers,
which are represented as tuples
\mintinline{elixir}{{:cpx, real, imag}}, where
\mintinline{elixir}{`real`} is the real part and
\mintinline{elixir}{`imag`} is the imaginary part of the complex number.
Since this entire module can be found on
\href{https://github.com/VincentFerrigan/kth-id1019-programming-ii/tree/main/tasks/7/mandelbrot/lib/cmplx.ex}{GitHub (lib/cmplx.ex)}
I will only go through the module's most important function;
\mintinline{elixir}{Cmplx.abs/1}.
It calculates the absolute
value (magnitude) of a complex number -- i.e.
the distance of the complex number from the origin in the complex plane.
% TODO: Gör fan alla, men skriv att du redan gått igenom sqr i subsectionen innan.
\inputminted[
    label=abs/1,
    firstline=54,
    lastline=57,
    xleftmargin=-3mm,  % Adjust this value as needed
    fontsize=\footnotesize,
]{elixir}{../lib/cmplx.ex}
\inputminted[
    label=iex abs/1,
    firstline=51,
    lastline=52,
    xleftmargin=-3mm,  % Adjust this value as needed
    fontsize=\footnotesize,
]{elixir}{../lib/cmplx.ex}

%This value is essential for determining the escape time of points in the Mandelbrot set calculation.
%The absolute value is used to test if the iterative computation should terminate.
\subsection*{Mandelbrot Computation Module}
\label{subsec:brot}
The
\mintinline{elixir}{Brot} module
focuses on the computation aspect.
It determines whether a point belongs to the Mandelbrot set
based on the iteration depth and complex number calculations.
It implements the core algorithm that performs the iterative calculation
to check if a given complex number escapes the set within a certain number
of iterations.

The Mandelbrot set is defined by a simple mathematical formula applied to complex numbers.
For each point $c$ in the complex plane, we iterate the formula
\(z_{n+1} = z^2_n + c\), starting with $z_{0}=0$.
A point $c$ is considered part of the Mandelbrot set if,
after an infinite number of iterations, the value of
$z$ does not escape to infinity.

In practice, we cannot iterate infinitely,
so we set a maximum number of iterations
\mintinline{elixir}{`max_iterations`} to decide whether
$z$ escapes or not.
\inputminted[
    label=Brot.mandelbrot/1,
    firstline=41,
    lastline=56,
    xleftmargin=-3mm,  % Adjust this value as needed
    fontsize=\footnotesize,
]{elixir}{../lib/cmplx.ex}

\noindent As shown in the helper function
\mintinline{elixir}{perform_iteration},
if $|z|$ becomes greater than our threshold $2$
before hitting the maximum iteration count, we consider
$c$ not part of the set.
The number of iterations it takes for
$z$ to escape gives us a way to color points not in the set,
creating the beautiful fractal images associated with the Mandelbrot set.

\subsection*{Color Module}
\label{subsec:color}
The
\mintinline{elixir}{Color} module is designed to map numerical values,
specifically the number of iterations it takes for a point to escape
(or be determined outside) the Mandelbrot set, to color values.
This mapping is essential for visualizing the Mandelbrot set,
where different colors can represent the ''speed'' at which points escape
to infinity, providing a visual cue to the complexity and boundary of the set.

%]{elixir}{../lib/day05.ex}
%Starting from
%\mintinline{elixir}{run_part_1/1},
%it reads the seeds and maps from the input, then for each seed:
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Parse Seeds and Maps:
%    Converts the seed and transformation maps strings into structured data.
%    \item Apply Transformations Sequentially: For each seed, it traverses through each map (seed-to-soil, soil-to-fertilizer, etc.), applying the respective transformation based on the mapping rules. This involves finding the appropriate transformation for the seed value in each map and calculating the new seed value.
%    \item Find Minimum Location Number: After applying all transformations to each seed, the process identifies the lowest resulting location number among all seeds.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%This approach is direct but not optimized for handling ranges,
%leading to the necessity for a different strategy in Part II.

%
%The process, kicked off by
%\mintinline{elixir}{run_part_2}, includes parsing the input into structured data for seeds and
%transformation maps.
%The structured data for these seeds are of the
%\mintinline{elixir}{`Range.t()`} type.
%Which is performed by the
%\mintinline{elixir}{create_ranges/1} function.

%
%To optimize processing, overlapping ranges are merged into single ranges.
%This is done by sorting the ranges and then merging any that overlap.
%
%\subsubsection*{Applying Transformation}
%For each range,
%transformations are applied based on the parsed maps.
%This involves checking for overlaps between the range and the transformation maps, and then calculating new ranges based on the transformations.
%This process might split ranges into smaller ones or adjust their start and end points according to the transformation rules.

%        xleftmargin=-3mm,  % Adjust this value as needed
%        fontsize=\footnotesize,
%    ]{elixir}{../lib/day05.ex}
%
%After applying all transformations, the resulting list of ranges may contain nested lists or nil values.
%These are flattened into a single list, and nil values are filtered out.
%
%Finally, it calculates the lowest location number from the transformed ranges.

\section*{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
%The key difference between the solutions for part I and part II lies in how they handle
%the input data and apply transformations.
%Part 1 processes individual seeds,
%applying transformations to each seed and determining the lowest location number through a direct,
%sequential approach.
%It utilizes functions like
%\mintinline{elixir}{do_traverse} and
%\mintinline{elixir}{locate} for this purpose, focusing on one seed at a time.
%
%Part 2, on the other hand, is optimized for handling ranges of seeds.
%It introduces a more complex logic to manage and transform ranges efficiently,
%avoiding processing each seed individually.
%This includes merging overlapping ranges with
%\mintinline{elixir}{`merge:overlapping/1`} and applying transformations to entire ranges at once.
%The traverse functions
%(\mintinline{elixir}{traverse/2} and
%\mintinline{elixir}{traverse/3})
%in part II are specifically designed to work with these ranges,
%employing logic to split and manipulate ranges based on the transformations,
%which differs significantly from the item-by-item approach in part II.
%
%Optimizing for part II was important due to the scale and efficiency needed when dealing with potentially millions of seeds.
%Using
%\mintinline{elixir}{do_traverse} and
%\mintinline{elixir}{locate}
%for individual seeds, as in part I, would become impractical for part II because
%processing each seed one by one would result in significant computational overhead and time complexity.
%By handling ranges of seeds, one can apply transformations to large groups of seeds simultaneously,
%significantly reducing the number of operations needed.
%This approach leverages the patterns in the input data to optimize processing,
%making it feasible to handle large datasets efficiently.
