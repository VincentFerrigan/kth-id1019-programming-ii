# My Maps
This project is based on assignments for a course in 'Programming II' given at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in
Stockholm. The assignment involves implementing a key-value database, also referred to as a "map". 
This database will be used to look up values
associated with keys, without making any assumptions about the keys. 

## Implementations:
### A. Map as a List

### B. Map as a Tree

## Additional Tasks:
Benchmarking with timer.tc and the Enum module for operations like add, lookup, and remove. 
This is to compare performance across implementations.
Comparison with Elixir's Built-in Map Module
