# Derivative

This project is based on assignments for a course in 'Programming II' given at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.
The assignment involved creating a program that finds the derivative of
functions at given value of x.
The given function is already parsed into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
An AST is a tree data structure that ”abstracts away” certain details. In
this case it represents the syntactic structure of the function in question.
